The Neighborhood Maps Project is an application that allows you to learn about various landmarks at San Diego State University.

To use the application, launch the 'index.html' file.

Once the site has loaded, you have the option of mousing over the 'places' on the google map to learn more about each location.

You also have the option of searching for a specific place via the search box.

If you would like to learn more about each location and get a look at the street view, click on the name of the location listed at the bottom of the page. When you click on the element, you will see a list of wikipedia articles and an image of the location will appear on the screen.
